# NYC Taxi Trip Duration
This project aim is to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. The primary dataset used is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

In Depth Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to find out important business insights from the data which could answer most of the business questions. Random Forest Regressor was used as an algorithm to predict ride durations of NYC Taxis.

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) was used as the evaluation metrics.
